The model of Kaggle can be found in the repo whynot-s/kaggle https://github.com/whynot-s/kaggle, which paper was published on **Automated Software Engineering 2018**, https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3240472.

The model of Github is being modified to fit current dataset and to improve the results.
